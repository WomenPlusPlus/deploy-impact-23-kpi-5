#### Main Branch:

The Main Branch of the frontend is developed using **React** with **Vite**. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows us to create reusable UI components, which makes development efficient and our codebase clean and easy to understand.

We chose Vite as our build tool because it offers a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It provides features like hot module replacement and esbuild-powered fast transpilation out of the box, which significantly improves our development speed.

Our application is connected with **Supabase**, an open-source Firebase alternative. We chose Supabase because it provides a comprehensive set of features including a real-time database, authentication services, auto-generated APIs, and native integration with React, which makes it an excellent choice for developing our application.
